Notes from 5.1-5.2

-Automated telephone trees were designed to save employers money, but also reduce hold time for customers. 
-Innovations in phone trees, voice recognition, or keypads often enables customers to find answers quickly.

- Dopamine is a type of neurotransmitter. Your body makes it, and your nervous system uses it to send messages between nerve cells. 
- That's why it's sometimes called a chemical messenger. Dopamine plays a role in how we feel pleasure. 
- It's a big part of our unique human ability to think and plan. The reward center in the brain releases dopamine in response to a pleasurable experience or hyperarousal. 
- The person develops a strong drive to seek out that pleasure again. 

-Technology has the unique ability to change everything around us. We've seen how the advancement of technology has eliminated menial jobs, and Deep Learning has the potential to optimize more advanced professions. Technology is an important tool because of its transformative nature. What I can do with tech to improve other education is to provide better access to sources of information and learning for disadvantaged individuals. In the first trimester, my project was a forum which was used to help people convey information and share ideas. In the second trimester, the project was focused on assessing knowledge by developing quizzes. I hope to follow this pattern of being part of unique projects that find creative methods of conveying information to shape others' educations.

1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
- People can feel powerful in a digitial world if they believe that they can operate anonymously. 
2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
-Someone who feels empowered may help someone that is not empowered by educating them. That person could help someone else have greater access to all that information. Another option is that they could choose to educate others.
3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
-It depends on what is being blocked or red taped. There are such barriers at Del Norte, such as when a site is deemed as not safe, and so the students don't have access to it.
