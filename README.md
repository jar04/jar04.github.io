Answering Questions about dopamine, bridging the digitak gap, and stativ bs dynamic programming.

- Dopamine is a type of neurotransmitter. Your body makes it, and your nervous system uses it to send messages between nerve cells. That's why it's sometimes called a chemical messenger. Dopamine plays a role in how we feel pleasure. It's a big part of our unique human ability to think and plan. The reward center in the brain releases dopamine in response to a pleasurable experience or hyperarousal. The person develops a strong drive to seek out that pleasure again.

-Technology has the unique ability to change everything around us. We've seen how the advancement of technology has eliminated menial jobs, and Deep Learning has the potential to optimize more advanced professions. Technology is an important tool because of its transformative nature. What I can do with tech to improve other education is to provide better access to sources of information and learning for disadvantaged individuals. In the first trimester, my project was a forum which was used to help people convey information and share ideas. In the second trimester, the project was focused on assessing knowledge by developing quizzes. I hope to follow this pattern of being part of unique projects that find creative methods of conveying information to shape others' educations.
