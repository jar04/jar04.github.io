# 5.6 - Safe Computing
- "Dad [t]ock on safe computing" - John Mortensen, March 22, 2022
- Personally identifiable information (PII)
- My fears of being doxxed!! How absolutely PROPHETIC!!!
- I have multi-factor authentication
- Somebody asks for your credit card number!?!! Just say NO!!!
- My computer computes very safely.  It is a safe computer.  It is a computer safer.

### Actions
1 Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.

Emails, names, faces.

2 What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?

I am very worried that someone may find old stuff online about me and I'm afraid that things I put online may be taken the wrong way.

3 Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.

Good passwords are difficult to guess and are long so that they can't be bruteforced.  Bad passwords are common and guessable, the easier it is for a hacker to guess the password the worse of a password it is.

4 Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.

Symmetric encryption is using the same key to encrypt and decrypt something while asymmetric encryption uses both public and private keys to asymmetrically encrypt and decrypt.

5 Provide and example of encryption we used in deployment.

The AWS images had keys required to SSH into them.

6 Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.

I've never been phished so I wouldn't know, but I've had a friend have their account in a certain MMO hacked.  Unfortunately this account was linked to their parent's credit card and the hacker purchased several expensive subscriptions on the account, costing the family a few thousand dollars.  The hacker didn't benefit from this at all...


# 5.5 - Licensing
- capitalism vs.... communism?!!?!?/!!1?!1!?1?!!
  - Mort's words not mine
- I know at least one person is going to go through my github someday and find this, I am genuinely sorry that you have had to see all of this.  All things go to cringe someday but please do not doxx me.
- Software can be under either proprietary or open-source licenses
  - Proprietary software is generally licensed so that the creators can patent or otherwise make a profit off of their software
  - Publicly licensed software is open to the *public* and is freely usable depending on the conditions of the specific license
- Programmers must consider their goals for their software when they license software
  - Want profit?  Is the software a corporate effort?  Use a proprietary license.
  - Don't have profit in mind?  Want your software to be as helpful to the public as possible?  Use an open-source license.
- Have to care about license because if you don't specify it, how are other people supposed to know what people can and can't do with the software?

### Action
1 When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages.

I've already licensed this repository under the [GNU GPLv3](/tri3CSPPortfolio/LICENSE) as with all of my other projects so far.  The only repository that isn't GPL is [FeanorBot](https://github.com/CalrethonOfMirkwood/FeanorBot) which is under the MIT license because the project I forked it off of was also under that license.

2. Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.

Already done, GNU GPLv3 for both.  I don't really see a reason to leave my tried and trusted GNU GPLv3.


# 5.4 - Crowdsourcing
- Crowdsourcing making something that the general public can contribute to.  Examples are:
  - cryptocurrency, the transactions are verified by public in a process known as mining
  - wikipedia, an online crowdsourced encyclopedia
  - COVID data is often crowdsourced
- Crowdsourcing is also very common in large statistics efforts or citizen science (citizen science itself is literally crowdsourcing)
- Crowdsourced data is often accessible through APIs
- Anything that someone can contribute to, regardless of scale, is arguably crowdsourced

### Action
1 CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?

I'm curious about the students in the school's thoughts on a club that I am trying to start, the Antilife Antichoice Club

2 What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?

I don't think crowdsourcing within Del Norte could have a significant impact on my project.  Our website is very personal and sensitive in nature, so we would be reluctant to have outsiders work on it.  Nobody in GSA seems to know much about computer science, I don't know of anyone else both trustable and competent at the school to work on the project.


# 5.3 - Computing Bias
- Creation has the biases of its creator
  - AI or other things that are made by one group but intended for everyone
- Algorithms may be made to intentionally promote some information but suppress others
  - Social media, dating apps
- Really what is bias?

### Action
(I did the breakout group)


# 5.2 - The Digital Divide
- The digital divide, the technology access gap
- Technology is not accessible to everyone, exaggerated by digitization during lockdowns
- DNHS gives personal computers to students, even home wifi.  Has several computer labs and public computers scattered around the school.
  - Clearly very privileged, not much of a digital divide and the neighborhood as a whole is very well-to-do
- The global technology gap isn't unreasonable considering how resources have been historically distributed
  - Haves vs. have-nots, the "have" object is a computer
- Still some restrictions at school
  - Red tape (like in the computer lab), school blocks ~~literally any unmanaged site I swear the thing works on a whitelist~~ questionable sites (legally required)
  - Need personal computers in class because red tape policies require an administrator to manually approve and implement any changes to the school computers (ex. updating even a single python library)
- I'm annoyed by the policies and just avoid them by using a VPN, but I fully understand why the school would have such rules
  - If someone who couldn't think of using a VPN tried to access a school-blocked site, they should be paying attention in class

### Action
1 How does someone empower himself in a digital world?

To be empowered means that someone has the power and knowledge to be free and make their own choices.  People empower themselves in a digital world by learning about technology and using technology that they understand and can use to their own liking.  Most important is general understanding of computers, I would say knowing *what* a computer does and *how* and *why* it works is much less important than knowing how to code (although coding is very helpful with learning the previous three points).

2 How does someone empowered help someone who is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.

The school already provides plenty of resources to access technology such as internet access and personal computers.  What they do not give is _unrestricted_ internet access.  For this specific issue can teach people about ways to get unrestricted access like *hint* *hint* tor or a VPN.  Don't use VPNs if you don't know what they are or do, many VPNs log your data and are unsafe.  ProtonVPN is a safe and free option (the free US servers are blocked, use a Dutch server).

3 Is paper or red table blocking digital empowerment?  Are such barriers at Del Norte?  Elsewhere?

No, it is the opposite of digital empowerment, but sometimes empowerment comes behind safety especially if the person in question is a child.  There are barriers within the school's digital access, as described above, but they are only in the school and can largely be worked around.  Unfortunately, some countries have entire sites blocked by the government and are not digitally empowered.


# 5.1
- Technology can be both helpful and harmful depending on how it is used
  - Can technology made to be harmful?
    - Yes, obviously.  Think about sheer number of malware out there.
    - Intentionally addictive video games and social media platforms
- Helpful technologies automate tasks for people
- Telephone automation is an example of technology used for good
  - Used to need operators, now saves time and money for both caller and company
- "Technology" is such a vague term that literally anything as advanced or more advanced than carved rock is arguably technology
  - Rocks can be used to bash heads in, but they can also hunt/grind food to feed people
  - Are modern computers any different?  There's never been *major* major cyberwarfare but I think one is inevitable.
- More of a tool than something inherently good or evil
- But are tools good or evil?

### Action
1 Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing

Communication vs. Disinformation/social manipulation

Online socialization vs. irl isolation

Fun vs. Addictive

2 Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?

Definitely a real thing, since corona I've been struggling with keeping focus/self-control as my time online increases.  It's getting harder and harder for me to focus on my homework, even assignments on paper, because the distractions are right in front of me.
